Hello world i love to program
My name is david ekechukwu, Mr kiran is the best python teacher
how is your day going
Curtains forcing their will
against the wind,
children sleep,
exchanging dreams with
seraphim. The city
drags itself awake on
subway straps; and
I, an alarm, awake as a
rumor of war
lie stretching into dawn
unasked and unheeded.
