#Hello world i love to program
#My name is david ekechukwu, Mr kiran is the best python teacher
#how is your day going
#Curtains forcing their will
#against the wind,
#children sleep,
#exchanging dreams with
#seraphim. The city
#drags itself awake on
#subway straps; and
#I, an alarm, awake as a
#rumor of war
#lie stretching into dawn
#unasked and unheeded.
