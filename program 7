Curtains forcing their will dad
against the wind mom,
children sleep noon,
exchanging dreams with repaper
seraphim. The city racecar
drags itself awake on saippuakivikauppias
subway straps; and tenet
I, an alarm, awake as a stats
rumor of war wow
lie stretching into dawn sagas
unasked and unheeded rotor.
